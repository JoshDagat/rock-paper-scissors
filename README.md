This is my version of the rock-paper-scissors project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The goal is to create a rock-paper-scissors with a focus on DOM manipulation and event listeners.


### Characters

---
#### Rocky

Rocky was happily minding his food stall when Paper-kun came to challenge him to a fight. Never one to back down, he quickly donned his gloves and tribal circlet to face his nemesis.

### Paper-kun

Paper-kun is passionate about his craft. He constantly is on the lookout for a good fight. Unfortunately for Rocky, he happened to be in Paper-kun sights at the right moment and time.

### Lobster

Meant to be Rocky's next menu, Lobster accepted his fate. He was ready to become the next 5 star Michelin dish. All of his affairs were in place, patiently he waited till Rocky would transform him into the best dish. Unfortunately, Rocky and Paper-kun's fight has delayed this fate. Felt robbed, he joins the fray, trying to remove Paper-kun from the picture.

### Gameplay

The game is straight-forward rock-paper-scissor except I threw in a lobster. The player has three buttons to choose from after which the computer random rolls till it chooses its fighter.

First to five wins the game.

### Changing Settings ⚙️

Adjusting the settings is pretty straightforward. On the top right there should be a ⚙️ icon. Click to open and the settings modal should pop-up.
From there you can adjust sound and music volume. You will also find the attributions there.
